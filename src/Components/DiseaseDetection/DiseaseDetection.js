            <p>Plant diseases affect the growth of their respective species. In addition, some research gaps are identified from which to obtain greater transparency for detecting diseases in plants, even before their symptoms appear clearly. diagnosis is one of the most important aspects of a plant pathologist's training. Without proper identification of the disease and the disease-causing agent, disease control measures can be a waste of time and money and can lead to further plant losses. Proper disease diagnosis is necessary.</p>
